            <p>Once you move your website from stage to production, give it a quick test-drive to ensure that you’re all set in terms of ecommerce website design, performance and navigation.

                Here’s a quick checklist:
                
                Review all calls-to-action and form titles on the homepage and landing pages.
                
                Test your checkout experience.
                
                Double-check payment processing integrations (credit cards, PayPal, Stripe, etc).
                
                Make sure that all images are high-definition but optimized for load speed.
                
                Look for missing product categories and descriptions.
                
                Check that all links and forms are functional.
                
                Verify that your tax settings are correct.
                
                Ensure that all the inventory is properly listed.
                
                Test your coupons/promo codes.
                
                Also, make sure your digital storefront displays equally well on desktop and mobile, and that the user experience is consistent throughout.Launching an ecommerce business ranges in complexity, and so do the platforms available to you. Whether you start with a complex platform or a turn-key solution, you may find you need some extra web development help at some point in your business lifecycle. 

                Now that you know about the web developer’s role in your ecommerce launch and maintenance process, the functionality you need to consider as you evaluate tech specs and the steps you should take prior to launch, you’re ready to get started.</p>

<p>What kind of online shopping experience do you want to give your customers? Some of the experiential features you may want to consider include (but are not limited to):

    Enabling your customers to filter search results by size, color or price with the click of a button.
    
    The ability to compare products side-by-side.
    
    Offering an optimized, one-page checkout experience.
    
    Promotions, discounts and other types of offers.
    
    Think about whether your target audience wants a simple and quick shopping experience — as they might with necessities like some consumer-packaged goods — or if they’ll take some time to browse your site and discover new products. You’ll likely want to structure your site for a different customer journey depending on your answer.</p>

            <h1>Understand your business goals.</h1>
            <p>The decision to sell online is a big one. And you can’t proceed with action until you figure out the operational bells and whistles.

                To do that, start with the why. 
                
                Why do you want to sell online? To attract more business — that’s easy. But how exactly do you plan to make that happen?
                
                Will you use your ecommerce business as an avenue for direct-to-consumer sales? 
                
                Do you want to drive online traffic to supplement brick-and-mortar operations? 
                
                Do you want to expand a B2C business to B2B or vice versa?
                
                Apart from your baseline goals, think in terms of ecommerce metrics.
                
                What kind of growth would you like to see post-launch, and how will you measure it? For example, what’s your goal in terms of weekly online sales volume? 
                
                Do you plan to sell locally or internationally, too? 
                
                What’s your plan for growing a customer lifetime value? 
                
                How many products do you plan to sell?</p>
